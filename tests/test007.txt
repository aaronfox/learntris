= t,I : drawing and selecting the active tetramino
: At any point in time while the game is running, there
: should be a single 'active' tetramino that the player
: is able to control. Normally these are chosen somewhat
: randomly at runtime, but for automated testing, there
: needs to be some way to set the active tetramino.
:
: There are exactly seven tetraminos and they each have
: specific names used by mathematicians and players of
: video games. This one is called the I tetramino, and
: in the game, it is generally colored cyan.
:
: After issuing the 'I' command, the active tetramino
: should be the 'I' tetramino, and it should be oriented
: horizontally.
:
: In order to verify that the active tetramino is correct,
: the tests need some way to ask what it looks like. This
: is the role of the 't' command: it displays the active
: tetramino.
