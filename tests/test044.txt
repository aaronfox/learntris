(Something Awesome)
= The Next Test
: Congratualations! Your learntris implementation passes all
: existing tests, and you've even created and passed a few of
: your own.
:
: Take a moment to pat yourself on the back for making it this far. :)
:
: Now it's time for the real test...
:
: Take a look at what you've built so far. Is this everything
: you'd want to see in a video game? Or is it missing a thing
: or two?
:
: This test case contradicts the very first one, so the only way
: to make it pass is to delete it, or replace it with something
: better. The choice is yours.
:
: Either way, you will need to open up testplan.org and search
: for the test named 'learntris.end'.
